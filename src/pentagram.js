                <h4>What is a pentagram?</h4>
                <div>
                A pentagram is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polygon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star polygon</a>, 
                and the simplest star polytope. Although everyone knows
                what it looks like, people may disagree on the numbers of vertices and edges on a pentagram. 
                In the context of star polytopes, we treat the pentagram as the first image above but not the second one. 
                </div>
                <ul>
                <li>
                In the first image,
                It has only 5 vertices on the outside. 
                There are 5 edges which intersect with each other. 
                However, we don't count the intersections as vertices of the pentagram. 
                </li>
                <li>
                We do <strong>not</strong> use the second image 
                as the definition here. That image has 10 vertices and 10 shorter edges.
                </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Self-intersecting</h4>
                <div>
                Using the first definition, the topological structure of 
                a pentagram is very similar to that of a pentagon.
                There are 5 vertices and 5 edges. Two edges meet at a vertex and two vertices are connected by an edge. 
                The pentagram can be viewed as a relaxed and special version of the pentagon.
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div>
                They are different because the edges of the pentagram intersect with each other whereas those of the
                pentagon don't. Another difference is that the entire pentagon are on the same side of an edge 
                and its extension, whereas a pentagram doesn't have this property (convexity). Thinking 
                of the edges of pentagram as laser beams helps understanding it, because laser beams can go 
                pass each other.
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div>
                Having accepted the pentagram as a special 
                and still legit pentagon, we can also talk about a <strong>regular</strong> pentagram
                as a special regular pentagon. 
                They share the following properties: the lengths of edges are all the same, 
                and the angles at the vertices are all the same.
                We can distinguish these two figures only by checking if the 
                edges intersect with each other or checking convexity.
                </div>

                <h4>Construction</h4>
                <div>
                We can construct a pentagram by applying either of the following two methods to a regular pentagon.
                </div>
                <div className = "figure-div">
                <figure>
                    <img src = {require('./images/polygon/pentagram_diagonal_5_1.png')} alt = 'static'/>
                    <figcaption>Method 1: faceting</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <figure>
                    <img src = {require('./images/polygon/pentagram_extend_5_1.png')} alt = 'static'/>
                    <figcaption>Method 2: stellation</figcaption>
                </figure>
                </div>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faceting</a>: 
                    In this process, we create new edges and keep the existing vertices. Starting from
                    each vertex, we skip the nearest neighbor and connect to the second vertex to get an edge (a diagonal of the pentagon).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellaton</a>:
                    Extending edges in both directions until they meet. In this process, we keep the edges 
                    (if you think of them as unbounded straight lines) and create new vertices. 
                    You can see a small pentagon in the middle of a pentagram. 
                    That can be seen as the original pentagon we extend from. 

                    The two edges that meet at a pentagram vertex are not adjacent to each other in the original pentagon. 
                    They are separated by another edge in the middle.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <div>
                One can see the duality between these two processes. If we swap "vertices" and "edges", and swap
                "connecting 2 vertices to form an edge" and "extend 2 edges to form a vertex", 
                one process becomes the other. 
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div>
                We can draw both processes in the same picture as below. In the core of the 
                pentagram, we have a red pentagon. On the outside we have a pentagon with yellow edges. The pentagram can be
                created by stellating the inner pentagon or faceting the outer pentagon.
                </div>
                <div className = "figure-div">
                <figure>

                <h4>Notation</h4>
                <div>
                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schl√§fli symbol</a> denotes the regular pentagon 
                as {'{'}5{'}'} because it has 5 sides. It denotes a pentagram as {'{'}5/2{'}'}. You can think of the number 2 
                as coming from the following processes.
                <ul>
                <li>
                Faceting. Starting from a vertex, you skip the nearest neighbor and connect to 
                the <strong>second</strong> vertex
                to construct an edge. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Stellaton. When we extend an edge, we construct a vertex when 
                it meets not the immediate neighboring edge, 
                but the <strong>second</strong> edge.
                </li>
                <li>
                Tracing the pentagram. Imagine you start from a vertex of a pentagam and
                follow the edges, when you come back to the same vertex, 
                you go around the center by <strong>2</strong> rounds 
                as oppose to 1 round for a pentagon.
                </li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div>
                You will see how the notation generalize when we talk about <Link to='/heptagram'>heptagrams</Link> in the next page.
                </div>

                <h4>Explosion</h4>
                <div>
                We can "explode" the pentagram by moving its edges away from the center.
                At some point, the moving edges form a pentagon.
                In higher dimensions, we will explode the polyhedra and polytopes by moving
                their faces or cells away from the center. We will see interesting connections
                between star polytopes and non-star polytopes, just like the
                connection we see now between the pentagram and the pentagon.
