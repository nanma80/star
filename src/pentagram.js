                <h4>Definition</h4>
                <div>
                A pentagram is a star polygon, and the simplest star polytope. Although everyone knows
                what it looks like, people may disagree about the numbers of vertices and edges on a pentagram.
                </div>
                <ul>
                <li>
                On the topic of star polytopes, we treat the pentagram as the first image above but not the second one. 
                It has only 5 vertices on the outside. There are 5 edges which are the diagonals of a pentagon.
                The edges intersect with each other. But we don't count the intersections as vertices of the pentagram. 
                </li>
                <li>
                We do not use the second image as the definition here. That image has 10 vertices and 10 shorter edges.
                </li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                Under the definition we use, a regular pentagram is very similar to a regular pentagon. Suppose we are given 
                the coordinates of 5 vertices, and 5 edges connecting 5 pairs of vertices. A regular pentagram and a regular pentagon
                share the following properties: the lengths of edges are all the same, and the angles at the vertices are all the same.
                We can distinguish these two figures only when we carefully examine if the edges intersect with each other or not,
                or, when we check if all the vertices are on the same side of edges (convexity). In this sense, a pentagram is
                a more relaxed version of a pentagon.
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div>
                If we use the definition in the second image, we would think of it as a decagon and it is not regular in any sense.
                </div>

                <h4>Construction</h4>
                <div>
                We can construct a pentagram by starting from a regular pentagon, and doing either of the following.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                    Constructing diagonals. We keep the original vertices of the pentagon and construct new edges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Extending edges in both directions until they meet. In this option, we keep the edges 
                    (if you think of them as unbounded straight lines) and create new vertices.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </div>

                <h4>Notation</h4>
                <div>
                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol">Schl√§fli symbol</a> denotes the regular pentagon 
                as {'{'}5{'}'} because it has 5 sides. It denotes a pentagram as {'{'}5/2{'}'}. You can think of the number 2 from
                the process of connecting vertices. Starting from a vertex, you skip the nearest neighbor and connect to the second vertex
                to construct an edge. Another way to come to 2 is to imagine you start from a vertex of a pentagam and
                follow the edges, when you come back to the same vertex, you go around the center by 2 rounds as oppose to 1 round for a pentagon.

                You will see how the notation generalize when we talk about heptagrams in the next page.
