        The regular icosahedron is the dual of the regular dodecahedron. It means the faces
        of one shape correspond to the vertices of the other. Specifically, if you place a
        vertex at the center of each face on a dodecahedron, the new vertices form an icosahedron.
        <br/>
        In the <Link to='/Polyhedron_5_3'>dodecahedron page</Link> we described the "north pole"
        as one of the face centers. The dual icosahedron will have a vertex at the "north pole".
        There are 5 neighboring vertices to the north pole, which are on the northern hemisphere.
        The same structure exists on the southern hemisphere.
        When we view the icosahedron directly above the north pole, the projection also has
        a 5-fold symmetry. 
        For consistency across the duality relationship, in any 3D shapes here, we call the "north pole"
        the face center of a dodecahedron, or a vertex of an icosahedron.
